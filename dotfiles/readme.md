# dotfiles

These are my dot files for linux installs
Initially comes from CentOS 7 install 
The idea is that i can pick up these files if needed for other installs with hopefully minimal change
It may be useful for others to use as a starting point or to take snippets

## .bashrc

Fairly basic .bashrc file with a custom prompt, some colouring, date/time in bash_history and a call to load .bash_aliases

## .bash_aliases

This started off from what i was using on a CentOS 7 install but most are fairly generic
I used it on some ubuntu installs so it now has some local ones for that too
It's mostly the more frequent commands in more memorable and/or more concise format which i imagine will evolve in time
Should also be useful so i don't have to build this collection again
Think it is just the yum and systemctl ones that are for CentOS and the apt ones for Ubuntu
