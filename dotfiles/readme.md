dotfiles

These are my dot files for linux installs
Initially comes from CentOS 7 install 
The idea is that i can pick up these files if needed for other installs with hopefully minimal need for change
It may be useful for others to use

.bashrc

Fairly basic .bashrc file with a custom prompt, some colouring, date/time in bash_history and a call to load .bash_aliases

.bash_aliases

This comes from CentOS 7 probably just the yum and systemctl ones that are local
It's mostly the more frequent commands in more memorable and/or more concise format which i imagine will evolve in time
Should also be useful so i don't have to build this collection again
