## bin
This is a collection of scripts which have been useful for various reasons
Some are more administrative while others for a specific purpose
Quality is variable and at most they might have been tried on CentOS and Ubuntu
I usually run bash shell so it's likely that's what it was designed for
As with the dotfiles, some of this I found quite useful code so may be useful on other Linux installs
